Project Statement: Cafe Management System

1. Problem Statement
   
I have noticed that many small cafes and food stalls still rely on pen and paper to calculate bills. This often leads to mistakes, especially when the shop is busy. Customers have to wait longer, and staff members struggle with mental math for totals and taxes. I felt there was a need for a simple, digital tool that could handle these calculations instantly without needing expensive or complicated software.

3. Scope of the Project

This project is a console-based application built to help small business owners manage their orders and billing more efficiently.

What the project does (In Scope):

Shows a clear digital menu with prices.

Lets the user add multiple items to a "cart" one by one.

Automatically handles the math (Total price + 5% GST).

Generates a neat text receipt for the customer.

Fixes small user errors, like typing "coffee" instead of "Coffee".

What it does not do (Out of Scope):

It doesn't track how much stock (ingredients) is left in the kitchen.

It doesn't handle online payments like UPI or Credit Cards yet.

It doesn't have a graphical interface (buttons and images); it runs in the terminal.

3. Target Users

Small Cafe Owners: Who need a free and reliable way to bill customers.

Cafe Staff: Who want to avoid calculation errors during rush hours.

Students: Who want to understand how billing logic works in Python.

4. High-Level Features

Digital Menu: Instantly displays all items and prices in a clean table.

Smart Ordering: You can keep adding items until you say "done."

Error Prevention: If you type an item name wrong, the system tells you instead of crashing.

Auto-Tax: It automatically adds a 5% tax to the bill, making it look professional.
